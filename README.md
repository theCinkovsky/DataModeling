# Python Data Modeling
Few projecs carried out for the purposes of university course.

## Description
Sample modeling & identification projects made in 2020.

### RNG
Simple code generating <b>uniformly distributed pseudo-random numbers</b>. The repeatability of generator allows you to reproduce numbers many times for any test purposes. Generator is based on a sawtooth transformation and compared with built-in NumPy solution.

### Inverse transform sampling
As above code also generates random numbers but from <b>triangular and exponential</b> probability density functions (PDF). Numbers are generated by inverse transform method. Second part of code allows generating random numbers from <b>Laplace</b> distribution using data created earlier.
